Sample README for SQL
# Users Table
## Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:
- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone Clementify/WEEK_SEVEN_LESSON_TWO_OBI_CLEMENTINA
2. Navigae to the desired folder using
sh
  cd WEEK_SEVEN_LESSON_TWO_OBI_CLEMENTINA
### Usage
1. Make sure you have your PostgreSQL client or pgAdmin open and connected to a database.
2. Run the schema.sql file to create the necessary tables for the database structure. You can do this by executing the contents of schema.sql in your SQL client.
3. Run the data.sql file to populate the tables with sample data. Similarly, execute the contents of data.sql in your SQL client.
4. Use the queries.sql file as a reference to execute SQL queries against your newly created database. You can copy and paste the queries from queries.sql into your SQL client to see the results.
